# hello-world
Just a little step to here.
I am living in Xiamen for three years. This period must be my best journery of my life. City is great and people are nice. Most important is I have encough money to enjoy the life. I spend 1000 RMB per month. When I got my first job, may salary was just 1200 RMB. Huge change and I thank many people that I can have this life.
